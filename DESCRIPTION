Description: The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) is a widely
    used simulator of agricultural systems.  This package includes a few basic
    functions to create, edit and run APSIM simulations from R.  It
    also includes functions to visualize the results of an APSIM simulation
    and perform sensitivity/uncertainty analysis of APSIM either via functions
    in the sensitivity package or by included emulator-based sensitivity
    analysis function. For more on APSIM including download instructions go to
    \url{www.apsim.info}.
